# Welcome to My TouchDesigner Repository!

This repository holds all my CC-licensed TouchDesigner work. My goal is to create a user-friendly library, and in the future, I plan to include either videos or small animations of each toe to help you browse and find what you need. 📚🔍

If you have any questions on how to make weird hardware parts work together, feel free to email me! I may be able to help you figure some things out :)

## Kinect 🕹️

- [Stream of Particles](kinect/basic_particle.toe) - A cool particle effect [OSX and Kinect 360 compatible]
- [Interactive Snow](kinect/interactive_snow.toe) - Create an interactive snowfall [OSX and Kinect 360 compatible]
- [Smokey People](kinect/smoke_kinect.toe) - Simulate smoke particles [OSX and Kinect 360 compatible], great for NVIDIA or Radeon

## Audio Reactive 🎵

- [Dancing Stream](audio_reactive/) - An audio-reactive visual effect [OSX compatible] 💃🎶
